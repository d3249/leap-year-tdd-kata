# Description

This is an introductory exercise to TDD in the form of a Kata.

The final goal es that the participant can practice the workflow in order to 
adopt the TDD _way of thinking_.

The exercise selected is the leap year test, which is progressively more complex but 
easy enough to understand.

Two empty (no code) files are provided. The test file has comments stating the rules that 
must be developed.

## Important

```bash
ruby test/leap_year_util_test.rb 
```
